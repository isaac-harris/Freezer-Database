# Freezer-Database

Hey Guys, thanks for checking out my page, this is my preliminary attempt at producing a Food Stock Managment System.

The essential premise is to use the software to keep track of your groceries in order to mitigate wastage. (UseBy dates, the location of food & basic notes can be stored).

This first iteration was created with a limited working knowledge of SQL Servers, as such you need to manually create the database and add the relevant connection string inside the .sln, future versions will implement SQLite to automatically create SQL databases.

Hope you enjoy, feel free to use as and where you wish.
